# smedja-tui Reference

`smedja-tui` is a ratatui-based agent dashboard. It runs inside any terminal (including the smedja GPU terminal). It connects to a running `smdjad` daemon via a Unix domain socket and streams turn events in real time.

---

## Launch

```sh
smedja-tui [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Env | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|
| `--sock <path>` | `SMEDJA_SOCK` | Override the daemon socket path (default: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smdjad.sock`) |
| `--mode <m>` | | Agent mode: `impl`, `review`, `test`, `sre`, `explain` |
| `--tier <t>` | | Tier override: `local`, `fast`, `deep` |
| `--session <id>` | | Attach to an existing session and replay its history |
| `--turn <n>` | | Rewind the resumed session to turn `n` before replaying (destructive) |

---

## Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [session rail]  │  main panel                  │  [right rails]
│  (Ctrl-W)        │  turn blocks, system messages │  context / LSP /
│                  │                               │  obs / cockpit
│──────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┤
│  input bar                          {N}c ≈{M}tok │
│──────────────────────────────────────────────────│
│  [I] [tier] [mode] [sess-id] [runner]  HH:MM:SS │  status bar
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The right rails are independent — multiple can be open at once (each takes a column). The left session rail and right rails reduce the main panel width.

---

## Modes

The TUI has two keyboard modes:

- **Input mode** `[I]` — the input bar is focused. Characters type into the bar. Press `Esc` to enter scroll mode.
- **Scroll / normal mode** `[N]` — the main panel is focused. Navigation keys scroll the view. Press `i` or `a` to return to input mode.

The current mode is shown in the status bar's `[I]` / `[N]` badge.

---

## Slash Commands

Type a `/` in the input bar to open the autocomplete popup. Commands are filtered as you type.

### Session

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/session` | Show the current session ID, mode, tier, and turn count |
| `/resume` | Open an interactive session picker; press `Enter` to reattach |
| `/resume <id>` | Resume the named session directly |
| `/resume <id> <turn>` | Rewind to turn `n` then replay (destructive — prunes later turns) |
| `/clear` | Clear the message display; the session conversation is preserved |
| `/briefing` | Show the session briefing (system prompt summary) |
| `/quit` | Exit smedja-tui |

### Model and Runner

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model` | List available models with GPU fit annotations (local runner) or runner's model list |
| `/model <name>` | Hot-swap to the named model; local runner: calls `local.swap`, not a relabel |
| `/switch` | Open an interactive runner picker |
| `/switch <runner>` | Switch to the named runner immediately |
| `/takeover <runner>` | Fork the current session to a new runner (keeps history) |
| `/tier <t>` | Set the routing tier: `local`, `fast`, or `deep`. Resolves the runner's model for that tier and pins it as the session model; the last runner + tier persist across restarts |
| `/login` | Authenticate with the current runner (OAuth / API key flow) |

### Loop Engine

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/loop status` | Show the status of the current active loop |
| `/loop list` | List all loops for the current workspace |
| `/loop create <goal>` | Start a new loop for the given goal |
| `/loop cancel` | Cancel the running loop |

### Roles, Approval, and Cowork

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agent` | List roles |
| `/agent <role>` | Set the active role: `code`/`impl`, `plan`, `research`, `debug`, `ask`, `review`, `test`, `sre`, `data`, `iac`, `orchestrator`. Each routes to a default `(client, tier)` and auto-loads `.smedja/roles/<role>.md` |
| `/cowork on\|off\|status` | Toggle / inspect cowork approval mode |
| `/approve` | List pending approvals |
| `/approve <id>` | Approve a pending approval (or use the inline `y`/`n`/`m` widget) |

**Approval** — mutating tool calls gate by default (ask-on-mutation) for every client. A pending approval shows an inline widget: `y` approve, `n` deny, `m` modify. Reads always pass; read-only roles can never mutate; `iac` always confirms.

**Permission mode** — cycle with **Shift-Tab**: `ask → accept_edits → plan → auto`.

### Code and Review

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/review` | Send the current `git diff HEAD` to the review role |
| `/test` | Run the project test suite (auto-detects `cargo`, `npm`, `go`, `python`) |
| `/test cargo` | Force cargo test (useful in monorepos) |
| `/test npm` | Force npm test |
| `/test go` | Force go test |
| `/test py` | Force pytest |
| `/lsp` | Show LSP server status and current diagnostic summary |

### Governance

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gov list` | List all govctl artifacts (work items, RFCs, ADRs) with id/kind/status/title |
| `/gov show <id>` | Show full detail for an artifact (e.g. `WI-001`, `RFC-001`, `ADR-001`) |
| `/gov create work-item <title>` | Create a new work item TOML in `gov/work-items/` |
| `/gov create rfc <title>` | Create a new RFC TOML in `gov/rfc/` |
| `/gov create adr <title>` | Create a new ADR TOML in `gov/adr/` |
| `/gov transition <id> <status>` | Update the status field of an artifact |

IDs auto-increment within their kind (WI-001, WI-002…; RFC-001…; ADR-001…). Valid transition statuses: `planned`, `in_progress`, `done`, `cancelled`, `draft`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `superseded`.

### OpenSpec

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/spec` | Browse OpenSpec changes in `openspec/changes/` |
| `/drawio <slug>` | Generate a draw.io mxGraph XML diagram for the named change |
| `/pptx <slug>` | Generate a python-pptx script for the named change |

### Information

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show the full help text (commands + keybindings) |
| `/health` | Check daemon connectivity (calls `session.list`) |
| `/metrics` | Show token usage and cost rollup by runner |
| `/quota` | Show daily token usage vs. `SMEDJA_DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT` |
| `/version` | Print the TUI and daemon versions; check for a newer release |
| `/upgrade` | Download and install the latest release in-place |

---

## Inline Context Fragments

Fragments are expanded daemon-side when the turn is received. They let you inject file contents, git state, or shell output without copying and pasting.

| Fragment | What it injects |
|----------|----------------|
| `@file <path>` | The contents of a workspace file. The path is validated to stay inside the workspace root. |
| `@git` | Output of `git status --short` and `git diff HEAD` (current working tree changes). |
| `@branch` | The current branch name and its upstream ref. |
| `@shell <cmd>` | The stdout of a shell command. When cowork mode is on, the command pauses for approval before running. |

> **Note:** `@shell` fragments are expanded daemon-side before the turn is submitted to the model.
> `@shell` is gated at submission time. Separately, the agent's own tool calls during a turn are gated by the permission policy (ask-on-mutation by default) — see **Roles, Approval, and Cowork** above.

## Key Bindings

### Input Mode

The input bar is a line editor with Emacs-style movement and a kill ring.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Submit the message |
| `↑` / `Ctrl-P` | Browse prompt history backwards |
| `↓` / `Ctrl-N` | Browse prompt history forwards |
| `Ctrl-R` | Toggle reverse history search — type to filter, `Enter` to accept |
| `Ctrl-G` | Open `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` / `vi` for multi-line composition; contents loaded back on exit |
| `Ctrl-B` | Move cursor left one character |
| `Ctrl-K` | Kill from cursor to end of line (push text to kill ring) |
| `Ctrl-U` | Kill from start of line to cursor (push text to kill ring) |
| `Ctrl-Y` | Yank the most recent kill ring entry at the cursor |
| `Shift-Tab` | Cycle the permission mode: `ask → accept_edits → plan → auto` |
| paste | Bracketed paste — multi-line text inserts as one edit (no premature submit) |
| `Esc` | Interrupt the in-flight turn if one is running; otherwise enter scroll / normal mode |

The kill ring holds up to 16 entries (VecDeque, oldest dropped on overflow). `Ctrl-Y` always yanks the most recent entry.

### Scroll / Normal Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` / `a` | Return to input mode |
| `j` / `k` | Scroll the main panel down / up one line |
| `G` | Scroll to the bottom |
| `gg` | Scroll to the top (press `g` twice) |
| `v` | Start visual line-selection mode (anchor at current line) |
| `y` | Yank the current selection to the in-memory clipboard |
| `t` | Copy the W3C `traceparent` from the most recent turn to the clipboard |
| `T` | Expand / collapse the thinking block badge (when the model emits thinking tokens) |
| `[` / `]` | Move the session rail cursor up / down |
| `Enter` | Resume the highlighted session (when session rail is open and focused) |
| `Esc` | Exit visual selection / return to input mode |

### Panel Toggles (both modes)

`Ctrl-A` works in both input and scroll mode. The rest work in scroll mode only.

| Key | Panel | Default |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `Ctrl-A` | Role cockpit — active role, tier, runner, in-flight turn status | Off |
| `Ctrl-F` | Context fill rail — live token slot breakdown | Off |
| `Ctrl-L` | LSP diagnostic panel | On |
| `Ctrl-O` | Observability panel — latency, tokens, cost, OTel status | On |
| `Ctrl-T` | Metrics overlay — per-runner token/cost/error rollup | Off |
| `Ctrl-W` | Session browser left-rail — 5 s refresh from `session.list` | Off |

---

## Panels

### Main Panel

The primary display area. Shows:

- **User messages** — your submitted text
- **System messages** — TUI notifications (queued, error, status changes)
- **Turn blocks** — structured `TurnBlock` output per assistant turn, each with:
  - Header: `turn N · runner · model · input→output tok · latency`
  - Tool call entries: `▸ tool_name  args  → result`
  - Inline diff for `edit_file` calls: `+` / `-` lines
  - Footer: `✓ complete - trace: <traceparent-short>`
- **Thinking blocks** — dim collapsible block while streaming; `╌ thinking (N chars) [T to expand] ╌` badge on completion

**Panel search**: press `/` (the literal slash, not a slash command) while in scroll mode to enter search — type to highlight matching lines.

### Role Cockpit (`Ctrl-A`)

A right-rail panel showing the active agent / role state during a turn. One row shows:

```
mode: impl   tier: deep   runner: claude
agent: impl-role   status: ●  in-flight
```

- `mode` / `tier` / `runner` from the current session
- `agent` from `TurnEvent.CorrelationCtx.agent_name` (populated on `started` NDJSON events)
- Status: `● in-flight` (spinning) / `◌ waiting` / `─ idle`
- Panel height: 6 rows

### Context Fill Rail (`Ctrl-F`, scroll mode only)

Shows live context window utilisation:

```
context
fill: ████████░░ 44%
locked prefix: 12 k
working:       22 k
budget:        50 k
```

Colour thresholds: green < 60%, yellow 60–80%, red > 80%.

### LSP Diagnostic Panel (`Ctrl-L`)

Shows the current LSP server status and diagnostic counts from `lsp.status` / `lsp.diagnostics` RPC polls (5 s interval):

```
LSP  rust-analyzer  running
E:2  W:5  H:0
```

### Observability Panel (`Ctrl-O`)

Shows:
- Session cost and token totals for the current session
- Turn latency samples (p50/p95/p99 over the last 50 turns)
- OTel status (whether `SMEDJA_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is configured)
- Daily token total vs. quota

### Metrics Overlay (`Ctrl-T`)

Per-runner rollup snapshot (fetched once on open, refreshed every ~3 s):

```
runner       tokens in   tokens out   cost ($)   errors
claude       1,200,000      340,000      4.12          0
local          800,000      220,000      0.00          1
```

Plus the token-economy savings section (SmartCrusher + stable-prefix savings).

### Session Browser (`Ctrl-W`)

A 28-column left-rail panel listing recent sessions (id, title, mode, last-updated). Refreshes every 5 s from `session.list`. Navigate with `[` / `]`; press `Enter` to resume.

---

## Status Bar

The status bar renders a row of modules at the bottom of the screen:

```
[I]  [deep]  [impl]  [a1b2c3d4]  [claude]  14:22:31
mode  tier    mode    session       runner    time
```

- `[I]` / `[N]` — current mode (input / scroll)
- Tier badge — colour-coded: cyan=local, blue=fast, magenta=deep
- Mode badge — the agent mode for this session
- Session badge — first 8 characters of the session ID
- Runner badge — current runner name
- Time — UTC wall clock

The status bar is TOML-configurable. Format: Starship-compatible module format.

---

## Cowork Mode

Enable with `/cowork on` (or `smj session start --cowork`). While active, every tool call from the agent pauses for approval before execution.

Approval prompts appear in the main panel as text lines. Press:
- `y` — approve and execute the tool call
- `n` — deny (the reason is fed back to the agent as a tool error)
- `m` — enter modify mode and rewrite the arguments before execution

Each decision is recorded in `smedja-ingot` as an audit event.

---

## OSC-9 Desktop Notifications

When a turn completes, the TUI emits `\e]9;turn complete\x07` to stdout. Terminals that support OSC-9 (Windows Terminal, iTerm2, and compatible emulators) display a desktop notification. No configuration required.
